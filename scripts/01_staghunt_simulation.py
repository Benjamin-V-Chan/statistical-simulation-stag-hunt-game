# Import required modules (os, csv, json) and staghunt_simulation_lib.
# Define simulation parameters:
#     - population_size, generations, initial_stag_prob, payoff_matrix, baseline, and optional seed.
# Call simulate_staghunt() with these parameters.
# Create the outputs/ folder if it does not exist.
# Open a CSV file (e.g., outputs/simulation_results.csv) for writing.
# Write CSV header and then write one row per generation using the results returned.
# Print a message indicating that the simulation is complete.
# End the script.
